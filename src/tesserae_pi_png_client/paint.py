"""inky high-level wrapper.

Unlike the bin client (which writes 4-bpp packed bytes straight into inky's
internal buffer), this client hands a PIL image to `inky.set_image()` and
lets the library's palette-projection + dithering code do the quantise.

That means:
  - We pay a PIL roundtrip and a per-frame quantise — slower than the bin path
  - We work with any panel inky supports (pHAT, wHAT, Impression 4/5.7/7.3/13.3)
  - We're not coupled to private inky internals, so the `inky` pin can be a
    range (>=2.0,<3) instead of an exact version

`inky` is imported lazily inside `auto_panel()` so:
  - The pure transform tests don't need inky installed
  - Module import succeeds on dev machines that can't `pip install inky[rpi]`
    (the RPi.GPIO transitive dep is Linux-only)
